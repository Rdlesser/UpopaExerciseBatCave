Bat Cave - Ideas to add in the future

▪ Add pickups:
    ⁃ Score bonus
    ⁃ Make bat invulnerable for a limited time (3 seconds)
    ⁃ Ammo - seedy fruit - turn seeds to ammo

▪ Change bat appearance and animation
    ⁃ Make it more cartoonish and appealing
    ⁃ Add purchasable skins for the bat
    ⁃ Add cavern themes - either purchasable or dependant on level / score

▪ Enemies:
    ⁃ Flying enemies to avoid. Spiders dropping from the ceiling on a web / Evil bats - add a shooting forward mechanism
    ⁃ Grounded enemies - Shoot by dropping some bomb (poo for a cartoonish effect / fruit seeds ) every click - bonus to score

▪ Add changing difficulty dependant on score
    ⁃ Every 50 points the randomisation range of the cave ceiling and floor meshes becomes larger

▪ Changing of scenery every 50 screens - change the theme of the cave background, floor and ceiling 
    ⁃ Icy theme
    ⁃ Desert theme
    - HellFire theme
    ⁃ …

▪ Change the movement physics:
    ⁃ Instead of moving the bat forward, make the bat fly in place (on the x axis) and just scroll the background - This will minimise the possibility that the bat reaches some extremely far positions, making us deal with those large numbers

▪ Add a continue mechanism on first death
    ⁃ Watch ad to continue
